title: "The hastle of installing graphical drivers"
---

Machine Learing
-------------
At the beginning of 2019 I decided to dive into the Machine Learning topic and ordered the book Deep Learning with Python
and started to work through it. But when I came to point where you had to install graphical drivers to install tensorflow-gpu
and then keras, I started to struggle.

Cuda
-------------
The cuda driver is a driver that allows your Nvidia-GPU to do very fast numerical calculations. But who ever made it, made it as 
uncompatible as possible. I have Ubuntu installed on my system and still a failed  many times using different installation guides.
In the end the very complex documentation from Nvidia himself worked out for me.

In conclusion I will never touch my drivers again and leave them like they are :)
