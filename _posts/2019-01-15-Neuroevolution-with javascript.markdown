title: "Neuroevolution with Javascript"
---

Flappy Bird
-------------
I made the game myself with p5 javascript library. After the game was complete
I added the nn.js and matrix.js files. With them I made a very simple neuroevolutionary 
program which only uses mutation and does not crossover. I had tons of problems with the
mutation function in the beginning but after it worked the birds started to fly... :)
If you let the program run for a little while, the birds have no problem getting a score in 
the thousands. Maybe later when I will come back to this project and implement crossover
and make the program better as a whole. But so far I am happy with it.



Pacman
-------------
First I again made a very bad version of Pacman with the p5 library. There are still a few 
features missing. The biggest of them all is that the monsters move randomly and do not target 
the player. Then I also implemented the neuroevolutionary part and the workflow is there but the
pacs do not seem to improve. I defnitly have to work on this very big problem.



Pong
-------------
Pong was the first game I made with p5 library. So far only the game is done, but I believe that 
it is not the hardest project to do, because the game is so simple.
